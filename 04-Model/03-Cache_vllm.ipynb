    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```LangChain``` provides optional caching layer for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for two reasons:\n",
    "- When requesting the same completions multiple times, it can **reduce the number of API calls** to the LLM provider and thus save costs.\n",
    "- By **reduing the number of API calls** to the LLM provider, it can **improve the running time of the application.**\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes you need to deploy your own LLM service, like on-premise system where you cannot reach cloud services.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use ```vllm``` OpenAI compatible API and utilize two kinds of cache, ```InMemoryCache``` and ```SQLiteCache```.  \n",
    "At end of each section we will compare wall times between before and after caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this is a tutorial for local LLM service case, we will remind you about how to use cache with OpenAI API service first.\n",
